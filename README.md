# gen-airr-profiling

**Work in progress ðŸš§**

This project explores **how to evaluate generative models** for Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) data and provides **profiling analyses of popular, existing models** in the field.

We aim to better understand the behaviour and output of these models by applying repertoire-level statistics, distributional analyses, and other comparisons to empirical immune receptor datasets.

## Goals

- Explore and assess evaluation methods for generative AIRR models
- Profile outputs of commonly used models (e.g., VAE, LSTM, SONIA)
- Compare generated repertoires to real-world immune data
- Identify strengths, biases, and limitations across models

## What This Is

- An **exploratory research project**, not a framework or software package
- A collection of scripts, notebooks, and results to support analysis and reproducibility
- A work in progress â€” structure, methods, and ideas are actively evolving
